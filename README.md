**Data Source:** The raw data for this project was provided in a CSV file containing 38 columns and approximately 1.5k rows. This data included information on employee demographics, job roles, salaries, tenure, and more.

**Data Cleaning and Processing:** Several steps were undertaken to prepare the data for analysis. Null values were removed, duplicate entries were eliminated, spelling errors were corrected, and appropriate data types were assigned. A conditional column was added for attrition count, assigning a value of 1 for 'yes' and 0 for 'no' based on the attrition column. Additionally, a new measure was created to calculate the attrition rate by dividing the total attrition count by the total employee count.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** To initiate the analysis, key performance indicators (KPIs) were identified to monitor employee performance and attrition. The following KPIs were created and visualized in Power BI:

- Employee count
- Attrition
- Attrition rate
- Average age
- Average income
- Average tenure

**Charts and Insights:**

Several charts and visualizations were used to gain insights into the employee data. Key insights from the analysis include:

- **Tree Map Chart:** Displayed the distribution of attrition by gender, revealing that 140 males and 79 females had left the company, indicating a higher attrition rate among male employees.
- **Pie Chart:** Showed attrition count by education field, with the highest attrition in Life Sciences (38%) and Medical Fields (27%).
- **Stacked Column Chart:** Illustrated attrition count by age group, showing the highest attrition in the 26-35 age group with 116.
- **Matrix Table:** Highlighted job roles by job satisfaction scores, with laboratory technicians, sales executives, and research scientists showing the highest attrition counts.
- **Funnel Chart:** Displayed attrition count by monthly salary slabs, with the highest attrition in the salary slab up to 5K, below the average company income of 6.5k.
- **Area Chart:** Showed attrition count by years in the company, with peaks after the first year, ten years, and five years.
- **Stacked Bar Chart:** Highlighted the top three job roles with the highest attrition counts: laboratory technicians, sales executives, and research scientists.

**Filters:** Department filters were implemented at the top of the dashboard, allowing users to filter the entire dashboard by selecting a specific department.

**Suggestions for the HR Department to Improve Employee Performance and Retention:**

1. Investigate the higher attrition rate among male employees and address their concerns.
2. Identify the root causes of high attrition in the Life Sciences and Medical Fields and take steps to retain these employees.
3. Address the concerns of employees aged 26-35, who have the highest attrition rate, and provide better career growth opportunities.
4. Review the job roles with the highest attrition rates, such as Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists, and address the underlying issues.
5. Reassess the salary structure, particularly for employees in the up-to-5K salary slab, and consider making salaries more competitive.
6. Offer training and development opportunities to help employees enhance their skills and advance their careers, improving job satisfaction and reducing attrition.
7. Create a supportive work environment, provide work-life balance opportunities, and offer recognition and rewards to increase employee engagement and retention.

**Conclusion:** This HR analytics dashboard provides crucial insights into employee data, aiding in better decision-making to enhance employee satisfaction and retention. By addressing employee issues and fostering a positive work environment, the HR department can help improve employee performance and retention, contributing to the organization's success and profitability.
